# One-Dimensional-Q-Learning-and-Reinforcement-Learning
Bellman equation gives a reward for every correct step. The Reinforcement Learning (RL) program I wrote follows this principle of the equation. The board is not small so it might take some to learning.

# Prerequisits
1. numpy  pip install numpy
2. time
3. random

# How to run
Open qLearning.py file and run it

# Conclusion
The following program shows great potential in learning but it is like trainging a blind man to drive where it is very hard to train as it requires visuals. Hence using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks that uses visuals will be the easier.
